                was an American Baptist minister and activist 
                who became the most visible spokesman and leader in the civil rights movement from 1955 
                until his assassination in 1968. An African American church leader and the son of early 
                civil rights activist and minister Martin Luther King Sr., King advanced civil rights
                 for people of color in the United States through nonviolence and civil disobedience. 
                 Inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi, he led targeted,
                  nonviolent resistance against Jim Crow laws and other forms of discrimination. He is also popular 
                  for a public speech he once made;
                  <blockquote>
                    <b class="quote">"</b><br>I still have a dream, a dream deeply rooted in the American dream – one day this nation will rise up and live up to its creed,
                     "We hold these truths to be self evident: that all men are created equal." I have a dream ...<br><b class="quote">"</b>
                  </blockquote>
                  which was delivered at the <strong>March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom</strong> on August 28, 1963.
